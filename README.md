# Face-detection
Recently, i have a project about face detection. So i want to share it in git. 
After i make it better i'll push it in my git. This time, i won't use the any pre-trained classifier online. I'll use the hog + linearsvm to detecte the face. Maybe it's not a very good choice, so if i have more time, i'll use more methods to see which is better.
